Then I decided to build a notification library to import in all my mobile apps.\r\n\r\nHow do it work?\r\n- Pretty simple. While coding you hardcode a URL into TellalConfig class. It checks this URL to find notification file which has information formatted as JSON and is a simple text file. Then shows it on screen. In notification file you need to specify a title, a message and a button text.\r\n\r\nWhere can I get it?\r\n- It is on github. Try this link to reach codes and library jar file. https://github.com/Canburakt/tellal\r\n\r\nHow can I use it?\r\n- Just add the jar file to your project, set TellalConfig.sourceURL and execute Tellal object. You can find an example project on github.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\n@canburakt\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nPlease contact me through comment seciton of this blog post.  http://www.canburaktumer.com/blog/android-tellal-project/\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
